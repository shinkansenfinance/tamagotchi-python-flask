# A toy/sample integration with Shinkansen

Live at: http://tamagotchi.fly.dev/

## Development

Install pre-commit hooks:

    $ pre-commit install

Install and run with poetry:

    $ poetry install
    $ poetry shell

Then set the following environment variables:

  - `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`: A random string.
  - `SHINKANSEN_CERTIFICATE_1` A certificate to validate Shinkansen's messages 
    (as a PEM string)
  - `SHINKANSEN_CERTIFICATE_2` An optional additional certificate to validate 
    Shinkansen's messages (as a PEM string)    
  - `TAMAGOTCHI_API_KEY`: A valid API Key for the Shinkansen's testing network
  - `TAMAGOTCHI_CERTIFICATE`: A certificate registered in Shinkansen's testing
    network (as a PEM string).
  - `TAMAGOTCHI_CERTIFICATE_PRIVATE_KEY`: The certificate private key
    (as a PEM string).
  - `TAMAGOTCHI_SENDER`: The identifier of the financial institution sending
     messages in the Shinkansen's testing network. Defaults to "TAMAGOTCHI" if
     not set.
  - `TAMAGOTCHI_LEGAL_NAME`: The legal name to be used for the sender.
    Defaults to "Fictional Tamagotchi SpA" if not set.
  - `TAMAGOTCHI_RUT`: The tax id to be used for the sender. Defaults to
    "11111111-1" if not set.
  - `TAMAGOTCHI_EMAIL`: The email used by the sender. Defaults to 
    team@shinkansen.cl if not set.
  - `TAMAGOTCHI_ACCOUNT_NUMBER`: The account number to be used for the sender.
    Defaults to "4242424242424242" if not set.
  - `TAMAGOTCHI_MAX_AMOUNT`: The maximum amount to allow in a payout. All payouts
    are automatically capped up to this amount. 
  - `SHINKANSEN_API_HOST`: The API host to hit. Defaults to 
    dev.shinkansen.finance if not set. 


And finally run it (inside the poetry shell):

    $ flask --app tamagotchi init-db
    $ flask --app tamagotchi --debug run

## Deploy

The current deploy was hastily put together and should be improved. But works.

It's a fairly simple docker image (see `Dockerfile`) which can be tested with
docker-compose up (see `docker-compose.yml`) and deployed to fly.io (see
`fly.toml`).

Deploy with:

    $ flyctl deploy && flyctl deploy -a tamagotchi-bice

(Make sure the env variables are set via `flyctl secrets add VAR=...`)

###Â Testing / Stressing Shinkansen API

This project also contains some code to stress test the Shinkansen Network. If you want to use it go to the `/tester/` url after setting the following environment variables:

  - `TESTER_CREDITOR_1`: A colon-separated string containing the information of the creditor receiving the payout (super important to set it right if you use the tester on production).
    - Name of the creditor
    - RUT in format XXXXXXXX-X
    - Bank ID (see https://docs.shinkansen.tech/docs/instituciones-financieras )
    - Account number (only numbers)
    - Account type (see https://docs.shinkansen.tech/docs/tipos-de-cuentas)
    - Email
  - `TESTER_CREDITOR_2`: Another creditor receiving payouts (with the same format)

For example:
```bash
$ export TESTER_CREDITOR_1="Test SpA:71132123-0:BANCO_BICE_CL:01152614:current_account:test@example.org" 
```
